            <p>Alberta is a province in Canada. It is mostly flat prairies and the temperatures range from 40 to -40 &deg;C (without wind chill). The wind can also be as fast as about 140 km/h, because of chinooks from the rocky mountains, which usually makes it feel a lot colder than it actually is. Alberta contains the Cardston, Alberta Temple which was the 6th temple ever built and the first built in Canada.</p>
