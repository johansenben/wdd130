            <p>&emsp;I am Ben Johansen. I am from Alberta, Canada.
                I recently finished doing a service mission in November of 2023, where I volunteered at the food bank, soup kitchen, and the Bishop's Storehouse and I served as an ordinance worker at the Cardston, Alberta Temple.
                Over the past 3 years I have taught myself 7 programming languages, including C++, C, Python, Java, C#, Javascript and Typescript. I have also taught myself to use HTML, CSS, Sass and Tailwind CSS. Currently, I prefer working with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Typescript. One of my favorite programming projects that I have done was an animated 3D Rubik's cube using only HTML and CSS.
                In my free time, I read, play video games or work on programming projects. Currently, my favorite book series is the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson and my second favorite series is Inheritance my Christopher Paolini.
                When there is enough water in the rivers and the weather is good during the summer, I enjoy kayaking with my family.

            <p>Alberta is a province in Canada. It is mostly flat prairies and the temperatures range from 40 to -40 &deg;C (without wind chill). The wind can also be as fast as about 140 km/h, because of chinooks from the rocky mountains, which usually makes it feel a lot colder than it actually is. Alberta contains the Cardston, Alberta Temple which was the 6th temple ever built and the first built in Canada.</p>
